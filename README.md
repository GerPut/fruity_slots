Fruity Slots

This is a game project I built using different ideas from codepen and other sites to complete. Similar expamples of slot machines was examined and I tried to mimic them to build my own. The project took about 1 week to complete and updates on code were made after I pushed the project to GitHub.

The aim of the game is to pull the handle of the machine(CSS animation in combination with Javascript - toggle()). Once the handle is pulled 3 different slots will spin and stop at different times (Javascript function in action). The handle will then return to its normal position once all three slots comes to a standstill. Depending on what combination of pictures the slots stop at wins or loses money that gets added or subtracted from your bankroll (Javascript conditionals will be checked in the main function of the game). The main Javascript function, as an example, is a snippet of code that I tweaked for my needs that made this game functional.

The pictures that creates the spinning action can be anything. I used easy to find emoji's as pictures. Styling this project was a joy. Various CSS animations were used to make this project stand out for example the gradient of the main container of the game and scrolling text with the title of the game.
